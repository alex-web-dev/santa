#Reviews
reviewsTitle: How was it last year

review1Text: We played Secret Santa with the whole office. I created a link to the game in the service and just wrote about it in Slack in the work chat room. Everyone was cool about it and supported the game. No one was left without presents :)

review2Text: I've been looking for a service where I can arrange Secret Santa for a long time. Before that I had to gather all my friends in one place and pull stickers from the basket. The service is certainly more convenient in this respect. Thank you!

review3Text: I work as an HR in a large company and accidentally came across the My Santa service on the internet. I tried it and had no regrets! All 320 employees played, and afterwards I received a lot of messages of gratitude for the holiday we had organized.

#FAQ
faqTitle: FAQ

faq1Title: What is Secret Santa anyway?
faq1Main: |
  <p>A Christmas game with simple rules: each participant works as a Secret Santa and secretly prepares a gift for another participant. In the end, everyone gets both the joy of preparing a surprise and a gift. And we are the service that automates this game.</p>

faq2Title: How much does it cost?
faq2Main: |
  <p>We have 3 plans:</p>
  <p>the <b>Friends</b> plan is free of charge and up to 10 players can play. It includes all basic features for a comfortable game.</p>
  <p><b>Company</b> plan: It's suitable if you have up to 35 players and need additional control over the players, for example, the function "Who's Santa". Price: $9</p>
  <p><b>Business</b> plan: for games with more than 35 players. Price: $19</p>

faq3Title: What are the mechanics of the game?
faq3Main: |
  <p>After you create the game we will prepare a special link that you need to distribute to the players. After they sign up, they need to tell us what they want for Christmas and exactly what not to give. And we will make sure that Secret Santa does his job.</p>

faq4Title: What if one of the players does not have mail for the game?
faq4Main: |
  <p>We advise you to create a temporary email on one of the popular email services. Without an individual mail for each player it will not be possible to play.</p>

faq5Title: What to do if there are still questions?
faq5Main: |
  <p>Write to <a href="mailto:hello@mysanta.ru">hello@mysanta.ru</a>. We will answer any questions as quickly as possible</p>
