Afterwards, we help you choose a gift.</p>

Secret Santa allows you to give each other valuable inexpensive gifts, saving time and money.</p>

  MySanta is not in the business of selling your Personal Data or information. We consider this information to be a vital
  part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal
  Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:<br />

  specific function, and we ensure that they are obligated to keep such information confidential.<br />
  <br />

  policies.<br />

  <br>
  7.7 If you or we terminate this Agreement, the clauses of these Terms that reasonably should survive termination of the
  Agreement will remain in effect.<br>
  <br>
  8. Disclaimers<br>
  <br>
  If you choose to use the Site or Collective Content, you do so voluntarily and at your sole risk. The Site and
  Collective Content is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, either express or implied.<br>
  <br>
  You agree that you have had whatever opportunity you deem necessary to investigate the Services, laws, rules, or
  regulations that may be applicable to your use of the Site and that you are not relying upon any statement of law or
  fact
  made by Mysanta relating to such use.<br>
  <br>
  The foregoing disclaimers apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. You may have other statutory rights. However,
  the duration of statutorily required warranties, if any, shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
  <br>
  <br>
  9. Liability<br>
  <br>
  You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of your access to
  and use of the Site and Collective Content, your publishing or viewing of any content via the Site or any other
  interaction you have with other Users whether in person or online remains with you. Neither Mysanta nor any other party
  involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Site or Collective Content will be liable for any incidental,
  special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service
  interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for
  personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with (i) these Terms, (ii) from the use
  of or inability to use the Site or Collective Content, or (iii) from any communications, interactions or meetings
  with other Users or other persons with whom you communicate, interact or meet with as a result of your use of the Site,
  whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and
  whether or not Mysanta has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is
  found to have failed of its essential purpose. In no event will Mysanta’s aggregate liability arising out of or in
  connection with these Terms and your use of the Site, or from the use of or inability to use the Site or Collective
  Content and in connection therewith, exceed the amounts you have paid or owe for use of the Site in the twelve (12)
  month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100), if no such payments
  have been made, as applicable. The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of
  the bargain between Mysanta and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for
  consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you.<br>
  <br>
  10. Indemnification<br>
  <br>
  You agree to release, defend (at Mysanta’s option), indemnify, and hold Mysanta and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and
  their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages,
  losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way
  connected with (i) your breach of these Terms, (ii) your improper use of the Site or any Services, (iii) your
  interaction with any User, including without limitation any injuries, losses or damages (whether compensatory, direct,
  incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of such interaction or
  use, or (iv) your breach of any laws, regulations or third party rights.<br>
  <br>
  11. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement<br>
  <br>
  11.1 This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply if you (i) reside in the United Kingdom; or (ii) do
  not reside in the United Kingdom, but bring any claim against Mysanta in the United Kingdom.<br>
  <br>
  11.2 Overview of Dispute Resolution Process. Mysanta is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute
  resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom Section 11.1
  applies:
  (1) an informal negotiation directly with Mysanta’s customer service team, and (2) a binding arbitration administered by
  the Angel Arbitration Association (“AAA”) using its specially designed Consumer Arbitration Rules (as modified by
  this Section 11). Specifically, the process provides:<br>
  <br>
  • Claims can be filed with AAA online (www.adr.org);<br>
  <br>
  • Arbitrators must be neutral and no party may unilaterally select an arbitrator;<br>
  <br>
  • Arbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of the arbitration, or relationship with any party;<br>
  <br>
  • Parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for certain claims, at their option;<br>
  <br>
  • The initial filing fee for the consumer is capped at $200;<br>
  <br>
  • The consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to participate live, by phone, video conference, or, for
  claims under $25,000, by the submission of documents;<br>
  <br>
  • The arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have received in court to resolve the party’s individual
  claim.<br>
  <br>
  11.3 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification. Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and Mysanta each agree
  to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will
  contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact Mysanta’s customer service team by emailing us
  at hello@mysanta.co, or at the contact addresses provided on the Site. If after a good faith effort to negotiate
  one of us feels the dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees
  to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim
  must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) provided to the other
  party, as specified in the AAA Rules.<br>
  <br>
  11.4 AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. YOU AND Mysanta MUTUALLY AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR
  RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT OR INTERPRETATION THEREOF, OR TO THE USE OF THE SITE,
  ANY Mysanta SERVICE OR THE COLLECTIVE CONTENT (COLLECTIVELY, “DISPUTES”) WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION (THE
  “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”). IF THERE IS A DISPUTE ABOUT WHETHER THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CAN BE ENFORCED OR APPLIES TO
  OUR DISPUTE, YOU AND Mysanta AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR WILL DECIDE THAT ISSUE.<br>
  <br>
  11.5 Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement. You and Mysanta each agree that the following claims are exceptions to the
  Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any claim
  related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade
  secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on
  exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).<br>
  <br>
  11.6 Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and
  thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will
  be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules“) then in effect, except as
  modified here. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.<br>
  <br>
  11.7 Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location. In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you,
  Mysanta agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option, (a) in the county where you
  reside; (b) in San Francisco County; (c) in any other location to which you and Mysanta both agree; (d) via phone or
  video conference; or (e) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the submission of documents to the
  arbitrator.<br>
  <br>
  11.8 Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the
  arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction.
  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary
  to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.<br>
  <br>
  11.9 JURY TRIAL WAIVER. YOU AND Mysanta ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AS
  TO ALL ARBITRABLE DISPUTES.<br>
  <br>
  11.10 NO CLASS ACTIONS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDINGS. YOU AND Mysanta ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE
  RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS USER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION,
  PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AS TO ALL DISPUTES. FURTHER, UNLESS YOU AND
  Mysanta BOTH OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT
  OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. IF THIS PARAGRAPH IS HELD UNENFORCEABLE WITH
  RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH
  DISPUTE.<br>
  <br>
  11.11 Severability. Except as provided in Section 11.10, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is
  deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement
  shall be given full force and effect.<br>
  <br>
  11.12 Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 (“Modification of These Terms”), if Mysanta changes this
  Section 11 (“Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement”) after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted
  any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email)
  within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that
  you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Mysanta in accordance with the provisions of the “Dispute Resolution and
  Arbitration Agreement” section as of the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to
  these Terms).<br>
  <br>
  11.13 Survival. Except as provided in Section 11.10, this Section 11 will survive any termination of these Terms and
  will continue to apply even if you stop using the Site or terminate your Mysanta account.<br>
  <br>
  12. Feedback<br>
  <br>
  We welcome and encourage you to provide feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Site (“Feedback“).
  You may submit Feedback by emailing us at hello@mysanta.co, or through the “Help” or “Contact Us” sections of the
  Site, or by other means of communication. Any Feedback you submit to us will be considered non-confidential and
  non-proprietary to you. By submitting Feedback to us, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free,
  irrevocable,
  sub-licensable, perpetual license to use and publish those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation to
  you.<br>
  <br>

  these Terms or otherwise permitted under law.<br>
